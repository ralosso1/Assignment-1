    <h2>Adoli Tesfu - a brief synopsis of change</h2>
        <p>As I grow more as a person and in understanding I begin to ask a similar question over and over again,
            who is Adoli? its something I wrestle with and finally come to a answer only to realize that
             which I discovered is only the begining of that which I orginally sought out to search. And in return it causes
             me to look deeper in this beautiful and strange thing we call the soul. Its sometimes diffucult when people
             may not understand I am growing like they are but always I must remember the extend the same grace I wish to recieve</p>
            <p>
             In this assignment i have created a Personal Page of who I am and aswell to go along with the assignments requirements
             I have also created a Grade Converter, a Staff page and a Temperature converter. It has been a while since I
             worked with HTML and CSS again but this Project will be a good challenge to help sharpen my skills and help me find the answers i need. I also attached a video to 
             explain my code. Thank you for your time!
